- Hello everybody, welcome! Thank you for being here
- I'm going to be talking about DevOps and what it means to ThoughtWorks and what we do with it

---

.image[
![business-card](images/business-card.jpg)
]

???

- My name is Moritz Heiber, I work for ThoughtWorks
- My official title is DevOps Birth Assistant
  - I help delivery babies, software babies; I help people build better software, faster, while using the idea of DevOps
- My unofficial title is DevOps Advocate
- Love to talk about DevOps, what it is, about its benefits and technology inspired by it
- This is a talk about DevOps and technology that it makes possible
- Since we're talking about DevOps, let's make sure we have a common understanding

---

# ThoughtWorkers are consultants

???

- First and foremost: We are consultants, we bring our talent to our clients and show them what the need to know and aspire to the achieve their goals
- Yes, we know a lot about managing infrastructure, writing tests and releasing software in an agile fassion
- And yes, we know about teaching, coaching and owning up to our mistakes just as well
- And we like to do DevOps, because reliance on a single individual or a team to keep your software releease process running is a **bad idea**

# DevOps

???

- As software engineers it's good to be responsible for all of what you do with software, not just your bugs
- Being in control means being able to take responsibility means learning fast, releasing faster
- It also means you are dependend on your team, you're not a lonesome warrior, you can consult with other members
- Your culture is as important as your code!

- **Now that I've talked about DevOps already, what is it though? What would be a good definition?**

# What is DevOps?

---

.image[
![buzzword!](images/buzzword-devops.jpg)
]

???

- A buzzword, mostly misunderstood
- I.e. "DevOps Engineer": What's that? Somebody improving the idea of development and operations through engineering?
  - People usually just mean infrastructure/ops engineers, DevOps sounds "better" (which is ridiculous)

---
class: backgroundgreen

# Where do we come from?

---

.image[
![ops-problem](images/ops-problem.jpg)
]

???
- Traditionally, software developers and operational staff
- Two departments so far away from each other, they sometimes cancel each other out.
- This is what you'd usually get when asking either department for help
- Projects get stuck in bug tracking tools, project management charts and inaccurate projections/expectations
- Technology and scope changes frequently, communication is lacking
- So, what's the alternative?

# DevOps is about ...

### The right attitude
### The right team chemistry
### The right tools for the job
]

???

- Right attitude: Trust your team to do the right thing, give feedback constantly and continuously, share knowledge early and often
- The right team chemistry: Specialist aren't bad, they just need to work together, be open to change and interested in new things
- The right tools for the job:
  - Don't be afraid to diversify! Use other tools on a regular basis
    - Don't get embroiled in the hammer/nail conundrum! Be sure you're applying the right approach, try a lot more, fail more often, allow people to fail

---

# Mixing it up!

???

- Single purpose, homogenous teams should be a thing of the past
- Specialists are totally okay, just one when they're concentrated in a single team
  - You are always going to be get yourself blocked because you rely on functionality or experience which isn't the realm of your specialized team
- Rather, try building teams with diverse backgrounds that don't rely on a single technology and/or language
- Focus on value driven team compositions with business impact

---

# Working together

.image[
]

???
- Pairing! Have you done it?
- Solution: Bring them together > DevOps
- Enable anyone to delivery their code to consumers

---

# Delivery without boundaries

???

- Do you remember the slide from just a couple of minutes ago? "Ops problem now"? That's a hard dependency and therefore a boundary. **You don't want that!**
- You want to deliver your release to your customers immediately, you believe in a rate of return!
- In fact, it's about continuous delivery most of the time

---

.quote[
> Continuous Delivery (CD) is a set of practices and principles in software engineering aimed at, **building, testing, and releasing software, faster and more frequently**. These principles help reduce the cost, time and risk of delivering changes, and ultimately value, to customers by allowing for **more incremental changes to applications in production**.
]

.right[.citation[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery (emphasize are mine)]]

???

- More value for customers, faster .. that's what everyone wants, right?
  - At least everyone should want it
- Incremental changes, tiny steps instead of huge, bloated changes you'll never be able to verify beforehand much less deploy efficiently

- And therefore, you have more time to focus on what's important
  - And that btw, includes collaborating, communicating and failing .. everything you need to embrace when doing DevOps AND CD!

# Delivery pipeline(s)

.image[
![gocd](images/gocd.jpg)
]

.right[.citation[https://go.cd]]

???

- This is the manifestation of a continuous delivery life cycle
  - A release pipeline, taking the modified source code and initiating a build
  - That build is getting integrated and tested
  - Possibly deployed to a staging environment, for manual testing or approval
  - And in the end the code in this pipeline ends up in production, all in one sweep
- This is continuous delivery.
- No more release planning, release schedules, release angst, release days, firefighting

- Ideally, all of these steps are well defined and can be logically separated. **As easy as that**.

- However, there are a few things I think are necessary to keep in mind and think about when going for CD

---
background-image: url(images/twu_lego3_late_integration.png)

# Building incremental, well tested software

???

- Your software stack and design need to support CD
- A gigantic mess of spaghetti code is hardly CD enabled
  - If it takes one release 3 hours to build I wouldn't do CD either
- Don't have to be microservices, but it helps ;)
  - But at least try to split some of your code into logical, independent units connected by open protocols
- You should not be afraid to deliver code to production immediately: There should not be a "trigger" somewhere that you'd have to press manually for delivery. Otherwise it's "Interrupted Delivery".
  - If you're afraid you're not testing well enough
- Use feature toggles where necessary; they can save you from the occasional stage fright
  - They're not a silver bullet for delivering important features and shouldn't keep you from iterating

# Trusting your code!

.left[
### If you're afraid of releasing you're not testing well enough
]

???

- Your code needs to have a test coverage which is above average to ensure you're delivering healthy code
- Healthy code implies and instills confidence and trust, in delivering it anywhere

- This isn't the job of QA!
  - They are not your dumb test monkeys!

- Imagine QA as a bunch of intelligent, bad ass mad scientists trying to continuously tear the very fabric of your product apart
