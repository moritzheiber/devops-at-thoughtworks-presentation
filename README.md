# Presentation about DevOps at ThoughtWorks

This is a brief and by no means representative presentation about DevOps and what it means at/to ThoughtWorks.

## Tools

This presentation is done in [RemarkJS](http://remarkjs.com). To navigate around the slides use either space, left-arrow or right-arrow. To see my notes press **`p`** for **presenter mode**. Other useful shortcuts are **c** (cloning + linking your current view) and **b** (blanking the current view).

### Local webserver

There's a `Rakefile` which starts a tine, built-in Ruby-based webserver. To use it, run:

```
$ bundle install --path vendor/bundle
$ bundle exec rake webserver
```

You can then browse through this presentation at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
